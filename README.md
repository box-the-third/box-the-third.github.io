This started out as my CSE Web Applications Mid term Assignment, and made it's way through to my workplace. 
I've added everything about me here, including a working psychometrics, CV, education information and the services I can provide as of today. 
The entire page is built heavily on html and css as opposed to component based development. 
It does contain JS for some of the design and construction elements.
